          <p> This course provides a broad skill set in full-stack web technologies. I strongly believe in the term " life long learning" so I am always on the lookout for new learning opportunities.

I will not only use this set of skills in my current position at a RCRDSHP (NFT platform), but I also aim to be able to do freelancing work as a developer. </p>
          <h3>Graphic Design at <a href="https://www.inscape.ac/">Inscape</a></h3>
      <p>I completed this 1 year fundamental Graphic Design course in 2021. It tought me the skill of visual communication, the idea of being able to communicate without words, drawing, creating, social media, movies, typography, animation, brands. Now I can use these skills to convey emotion, meaning and understanding through visual elements.</p>
